# 🐦 Tweets Sentiment Analysis
## Project Overview
This project analyzes the sentiment of tweets by classifying each tweet as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**. It uses **VADER** (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner), a lexicon- and rule-based model specially tuned for social media text. The core application is a **web app built with Streamlit**, a Python framework that swiftly converts scripts into interactive web apps.

Users can enter a single tweet for instant sentiment analysis or upload a CSV file of multiple tweets for batch processing. The app displays sentiment scores and visualizes the results.

## Key Features
- **Single and Batch Analysis:** Analyze individual tweets on the fly or upload CSV files of tweets for bulk processing.
- **VADER Sentiment Scoring:** Utilizes NLTK’s VADER lexicon to assign sentiment polarity scores (positive, negative, neutral).
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Displays charts like bar plots to show sentiment distribution and statistics using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Streamlit Interface:** User-friendly UI built with Streamlit, requiring no prior web development experience.

## Usage

### Launch the app
Run the Streamlit application with:
streamlit run app.py


This command will start a local server and open the app in your web browser.

### How to use the app
- Enter a single tweet in the provided input box for instant sentiment analysis.
- Upload a CSV file with a column of tweet texts to analyze multiple tweets at once.
- View individual sentiment results and overall sentiment distribution charts generated by the app.

## Notes

- Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
- The CSV file for batch processing should contain a column with tweet texts, preferably named clearly.
- VADER works best with social-media-like text.
- The app requires an active internet connection for Streamlit features.
